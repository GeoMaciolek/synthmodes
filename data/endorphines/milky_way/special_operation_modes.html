	<h2>Special Operation Modes:</h2>
	 <h3>Summary</h3>
		<p style="text-align: left;">Apart from being a very flexible fx processor, Milky Way also has a couple of tricks up its sleeve. The 3 special modes are Meta FX, Spatial Movement and Saturation Overkill. <br>
		<br>
	</p>
		
	    <h4>Meta FX:</h4>
			<p style="text-align: left;">This mode allows you to scan through the fx with an external CV, which can open up the whole world of sound design possibilities. To enter this mode hold press Type + Tap for 1 second. Cabin Pressure and Cabin Fever knobs still control the FX parameters, but now the CV input for Cabin Pressure will be your FX scan input, which accepts voltages in the range of -5V…+5V. <br>
				<br>
				<ul>
				<li> 0…+5V external CV will scan through the current bank of FX. </li>
				<li> -5V…0 external CV will scan through the unselected bank of FX. </li>
				</ul>
				<br>
			Every time you switch the FX algorithm, the FX parameters will be stored, this way you can fine tune the sweet spots for each algorithm and Meta Sequence the algorithms with higher precision and musicality. <br>
			<br>
		</p>

		<h4>Spatial FX</h4>
			<p style="text-align: left;">Pressing the ‘Type’ button for longer than 1 second will enable panning/xfade mode and the LED inside the triangle will light up fuchsia.<br>
			<br>
			Brightness of LEDs 1 and 2 indicates the output level of ‘in1’ and ‘in2’ at the ‘out 1’. Brightness of LEDs 3 and 4 indicates the output level of ‘in1’ and ‘in2’ at the ‘out 2’.<br>
			<br>
			Cabin Fever control with CV will adjust crossfade (blending) between ‘in1’ and ‘in2’ as they appear in separate ‘out1’ and ‘out2’ (full CCW) or in both outputs (noon) or in reversed outputs (full CW). By default the position of the Cabin Fever knob is set to fully CCW. <br>
			<br>
			Cabin Pressure control with CV will adjust final panning of both ‘in1’ and ‘in2’ to the ‘out1’ and ‘out2’ after the blending stage. By default the Cabin Pressure knob is set at 12:00. <br>
			<br>
		</p>

		<h4>Saturation Overkill</h4>
			<p style="text-align: left;">Once the Volume knob crosses 3 o'clock position and further, the status LED blinks RED and the overall signal starts to saturate. VCA CV input works in the range from 0V (full silence) to 5V (max. volume limit set by the knob (incl. saturation). Saturation can add warmth to the sound and also compress the dynamic range, which can be especially useful for percussion.<br>
