	<h2>FX Types</h2>
	 <h3>Summary</h3>
		<p style="text-align: left;">Milky Way features a total of 16 fx types allocated to 2 banks of 8 fx each. Press the Type button to scroll through the fx in a bank, short press <em>Type + Tap</em> to switch the bank. Airways Bank 1 is shown by the Blue LED and Darkwaves Bank 2 is shown by the Red LED.<br>
		<br>

		The first effect bank Airways contains effects tailored for tonal content. It recreates different ambient spaces. The effects are approximately arranged by size – going from bigger spaces (like halls) to smaller ones finishing with delays and chorus The second bank Darkwaves contains 8 effects suitable for percussive sounds and serves a variety of different flavours. See https://airways.endorphin.es for more details and latest updates. <br>

		<h3>Airways Bank:</h3>
		<p style="text-align: left;">
			<b>HALL REVERB</b>:  <em>Cabin fever</em> knob defines the decay of the reverb or hall size. Holding <em>tap</em> for longer than 1 second enables the secondary function for <em>cabin fever</em>: fixed hi-pass filter to cut off low frequencies and have more ‘air’ in the final output.<br>
			<br>
			<b>SHIMMER REVERB</b>: is a variation of the hall reverb with a pitch shifter to create choir-like, huge and unrealistic spaces. The primary <em>cabin fever</em> function defines the decay and the secondary function defines the amount of pitch-shifter mixed into the original reverb.<br>
			<br>
			<b>STEREO ROOM REVERB</b>: recreates a sort of stereo room ambience. Primary <em>cabin fever</em> parameter defines room size and the secondary defines the stereo spread of the reverb, from mono up to a huge stereo spread. <br>
			<br>
			<b>PLATE REVERB</b>: The primary <em>cabin fever</em> defines the decay of the reverb. In real life equivalent this is the distance from the pickups to the metal plate which is how long the tail of the reverb is present. Secondary parameter defines the amount of pre-delay to distant sounds in ambience.<br>
			<br>
			<b>SPRING REVERB</b>: The primary <em>cabin fever</em> defines the decay of the reverb. With the <em>tap</em> button you can simulate a sound as if you pluck the real spring with your finger. The secondary function is tied to the <em>tap</em> button’s ‘pluck the spring’ feature and defines the decay of how fast the spring will calm down after manually plucking it.<br>
			<br>
			<b>PING-PONG DELAY</b>: is a stereo clocked delay. A <em>tap</em> is usually three or more short clicks on the <em>tap</em> button. The primary <em>cabin fever</em> parameter defines the feedback of the delay or repeats. The secondary defines the clock division of the incoming tap/clock: 1, 3/4, 2/3, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/8. <br>
			<br>
			<b>TAPE ECHO</b>: is a delay with 3 fixed playback heads. Primary <em>cabin fever</em> parameter defines the delay repeat rate which is the speed of tape. The <em>tap</em> button works in a limited frequency range of manual tapping and defines the amount of feedback. The secondary works as a divider for the incoming clock. <br>
			<br>
			<b>CHORUS</b>: Primary <em>cabin fever</em> knob defines the feedback amount. In average amounts, it creates a typical unison effect, however, in <em>full CW</em> it goes to an infinite feedback resulting in a surrealistic ambient. Secondary parameter defines the modulation depth, which is <em>full on</em> by default. <br>
			<br>
		</p>
	    <h3>Darkwaves Bank:</h3>
		<p style="text-align: left;">
			<b>GATED REVERB</b>:  is based around plate reverb with noise gate. The primary <em>cabin fever</em> defines the reverb decay, but the secondary defines the threshold of the noise gate. Noise gate’s attack and decay are fixed and chosen experimentally to fit most musical styles.<br>
			<br>
			<b>SPRING REVERB</b>: The primary <em>cabin fever</em> defines the decay of the reverb. With the ‘tap’ button you can simulate a sound as if you pluck the real spring with your finger. The secondary function is tied to the ‘tap’ button’s ‘pluck the spring’ feature and defines the DECAY of how fast the spring will calm down after manually plucking it. <br>
			<br>
			<b>REVERSED REVERB</b>: takes the reverb tail of the sound and reverses it. If applied on drums like snare then it creates a breathing effect. <em>Cabin pressure</em> knob defines the pre-delay time and acts as dry/wet control. 'Cabin fever' sets the reverb decay value. Holding <em>tap</em> for longer than 1 second enables the secondary function for <em>cabin fever</em>: damping, i.e. volume of the tail (in our case tail = 'head' as the tail is reversed). <br>
			<br>
			<b>FLANGER</b>: The <em>cabin pressure</em> knob sets the amount of delay. With primary <em>cabin fever</em> we set the LFO speed. The secondary defines the feedback. Playing with those three parameters allows one to achieve sweeping, airplane engine-like sound with a pretty wide range. <br>
			<br>
			<b>RING MODULATOR</b>: multiplies the signal with an internal sine wave oscillator. <em>Cabin pressure</em> defines the amount of modulation and ‘cabin fever’ defines the speed of the oscillator. Secret ingredient – feedback! Its amount is controlled by the secondary ‘cabin fever’ and brings special dirtiness to the sounds. <br>
			<br>
			<b>OVERDRIVE</b>: <em>Cabin pressure</em> knob adjusts the drive amount with volume compensation, while ‘cabin fever’ defines the tone control as usually found in guitar pedals. The <em>tap</em> button makes the effect active or bypassed, like the switch on a guitar pedal – and so does ‘cabin fever’ latching trigger CV input. <br>
			<br>
			<b>PEAK COMPRESSOR</b>: <em>Cabin pressure</em> knob defines the threshold from -90dB to 0dB (fully CW). Primary ‘cabin fever’ sets the amount of gain reduction (ratio) from 1 to 25. Secondary parameter defines the attack, from 1 to 200 msec. Release is always <em>auto</em>. <em>Cabin fever</em> CV input is an unattenuated side-chain input. <br>
			<br>
			<b>FREEZER/LOOPER</b>: When <em>tap</em> is pressed (or <em>cabin fever</em> CV gate is ON), the audio is looped by the grain length defined by the <em>cabin fever</em> knob – and with the speed – defined by <em>cabin pressure</em> knob or CV – applied. <br>
