		<p style="text-align: left;">
			<ul>
				<li> To switch between the FX within the bank press the Type button.</li> <br>
				<br>
				<li> To switch FX banks short press Type + Tap buttons. </li> <br>
				<br>
				<li> To control the secondary FX parameter hold press the Tap button, now Cabin Fever controls this secondary parameter. </li> <br>
				<br>
				<li> The first FX bank Airways contains the following FX: HALL REVERB, SHIMMER REVERB, STEREO ROOM REVERB, PLATE REVERB, SPRING REVERB, PING-PONG DELAY, TAPE ECHO, CHORUS; where the first 4 are shown by the fully lit LEDs and 5-8 are shown by dimly lit LEDs. </li> <br>
				<br>
				<li> The second FX bank Darkwaves contains the following FX: GATED REVERB, SPRING REVERB, REVERSED REVERB, FLANGER, RING MODULATOR, OVERDRIVE, PEAK COMPRESSOR, FREEZER/LOOPER; where the first 4 are shown by the fully lit LEDs and 5-8 are shown by dimly lit LEDs. </li> <br>
				<br>
				<li> To enter Meta FX mode, which allows you to sequence the FX using external CV, hold press Type + Tap for 1 second. Cabin Pressure and Cabin Fever knobs still control the FX parameters, but now the CV input for Cabin Pressure will be your FX scan input, which accepts voltages in the range of -5V…+5V. Voltages in the range 0-5V sequence the FX of the current bank and voltages in the range -5V-0 scan through the FX in the other bank. </li> <br>
				<br>
				<li> To enter Spatial FX mode hold press the Type button for longer than 1 second. Cabin Fever control with CV will adjust crossfade (blending) between ‘in1’ and ‘in2’ as they appear in separate ‘out1’ and ‘out2’ (full CCW) or in both outputs (noon) or in reversed outputs (full CW). By default the position of the Cabin Fever knob is set to fully CCW. Cabin Pressure control with CV will adjust final panning of both ‘in1’ and ‘in2’ to the ‘out1’ and ‘out2’ after the blending stage. By default the Cabin Pressure knob is set at 12:00. </li> <br>
