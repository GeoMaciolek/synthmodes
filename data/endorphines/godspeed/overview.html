	  <h2>Overview</h2>

		<p style="text-align: left;">
			Godspeed is a multi waveform VCO with a Strong-zero oscillator core that allows for more musical and on the fly FM modulation. Designed with performance in mind it has a built in autotuner that simply tunes the oscillator to the nearest A note, saving you time and nerves during the sound check on stage. 
      The oscillator has 3 waveform outputs, 2 of which have variable waveforms and the other one is a square sub oscillator to beef up your leads / bass lines. Additional noise generator is built into the even / odd output to add extra character and thickness to your sound.<br>
      <br>
      <h3>Waveform outputs:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><h4>Sine / Fold:</h4> By default this output has a sine wave, but additional waveshaping using the Furthrrrr wavefolder can be applied using the Furhtrrrrr / Timbre knob. This output lets you explore the Westcoast synthesis and also works great for percussive sounds.</li>
        <li><h4>Even / Odd:</h4> Lets you continuously morph between Even and Odd using the Furhtrrrr / Timbre knob. Prepatched discrete square wave sub-oscillator adds an additional low end to your bass line and a built-in noise generator provides extra thickness to the sound, similar to the SH101 oscillator section. To add noise to the even / odd output simply hold-press the Tune button and turn the Furthrrrrr / Timbre knob in the CW direction.</li>
        <li><h4>Sub:</h4> Square wave sub oscillator, output tuned 1 octave below the base frequency set by the Frequency knob.</li>
      </ul>
