	<h2>Compressor Modes:</h2>
		<p style="text-align: left;">The built in compressor features 3 different modes of dynamic processing of audio signals.
		To switch different modes, hold press all 4 encoders for longer than 1 second until you see the Sidechain LED blink either 1, 2 or 3 times showing the selected mode.<br>
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li><b>1) Ducking with CV:</b>The input of the COCKPIT accepts unipolar CV from 0 to approximately +5V. Everything that goes above +5V is being saturated, and everything that is below zero will be cut off.The sidechain knob adjusts the level of ducking. Adjust it to the desired pumping level/intensity. The blue LED near that knob shows the amplitude of the input signal and lights up when the ducking level increases. TIPP: When no plug is inserted into the sidechain jack, the sum of all four channels is sent to the sidechain input of the ducking compressor. That connection may seem a bit experimental (since the channel generates a CV envelope from the full mix and it may sound more like amplitude modulation), however at some point it may bring interesting results.</li> <br>
			<br>
			<li><b>2) Ducking with audio:</b>The sidechain input is amplified by approx. 10 times with an envelope follower at the input. Now you may simply input a sound source (a kick or snare drum for instance – at a consumer line level – approx. 1Vpp) and the CV will be extracted from that audio source and applied to the channels you assigned to the ducking by pressing-and-holding the encoder for over one second (just as you did in the CV in mode described above). Tipp: If the ducking effect seems too hefty, it may be that the audio you want to use is too 'hot' – attenuating may help. </li><br>
			<br>
			<li><b>3) Ducking with triggers:</b>The sidechain input accepts triggers in standard modular level (everything that is higher than 1V is recognized as on and lower than 250mV as off). Every trigger generates an internal envelope (falling ramp) in the COCKPIT. That envelope has instant (zero) attack and the decay time is defined by the sidechain knob. Time of decay varies from 10ms to 10 seconds and at full CCW knob position there is no effect applied. This mode works great if you don’t have an extra envelope in your system, but also because you can control the sidechain release time independently from your audio and cv sources, giving you more control over the dynamics.</li>
