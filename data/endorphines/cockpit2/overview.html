	  <h2>Overview</h2>

		<p style="text-align: left;">
			Cockpit 2 is a stereo mixer designed with performance in mind. It can either be used as a 4 channel stereo mixer or 4 channel mono mixer, or anything in between. The user defines how the module behaves. The 3U version has 4 jumpers on the back that switch between stereo / mono functionality, while the 1U version has the first channel set to stereo with one input jack and the other 3 channels feature 2 inputs each for the L and R audio input. <br>
      <br>
      The levels of each channel are controlled using 4 onboard encoders with Red / Blue LEDs that make it daltonic friendly. The same encoders can be pressed to mute / unmute each of the channels.<br>
      <br>
      Built-in compressor can either run on the whole mix by reducing big audio peaks or can be used along with the external sidechain input. Each channel can have a different level of sidechain configured by hold - pressing channelâ€™s encoder while turning it CW to increase the sidechain amount. This is very useful if you want to give your mix more dynamics and generally to avoid clashing frequencies between Kick and Bass for example.<br>
