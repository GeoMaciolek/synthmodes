	<h2>Filter Types</h2>
		<p style="text-align: left;">Squawk Dirty To Me features 8 different filter types.<br>
		<br>
		</p>
		<p style="text-align: left;">
			<b>1) 24 DB/OCT TRANSISTOR LADDER</b>:  zero-delay feedback low-pass filter modelled after the famous Minimoog filter.<br>
			<br>
			<b>2) MS-20 12 DB/OCT</b>: zero-delay feedback OTA-low-pass filter. Be careful, this filter has very powerful and dirty resonance.<br>
			<br>
			<b>3) 12 DB/OCT LO-PASS GATE</b>: non-resonant zero-delay feedback filter where instead of the resonance, we control the DECAY closing time of the virtual vactrol. While ‘pinging’ Cutoff CV with a short pulse of voltage and adjusting the decay will give us that distinct ‘Buchla Bongo’ sound. <br>
			<br>
			<b>4) 12 DB/OCT RESONANT LOW-PASS GATE</b>: variation of the zero-delay feedback vactrol filter model III with fixed fast decay and full control over the resonance. The resonance of the sound is ringing, just as it may be expected from a typical LPG.<br>
			<br>
			<b>5) 12 DB/OCT DJ ISOLATOR-STYLE BIPOLAR FILTER</b>: zero-delay feedback state-variable filter: Sound is unfiltered when the Cutoff knob is in the middle/noon position. It filters high frequencies/low-pass, when turning the knob CCW and filters low frequencies/hi-pass, when turning the knob CW from its middle position.<br>
			<br>
			<b>6) 12 DB/OCT HIGH-PASS STATE-VARIABLE FILTER</b>: zero delay feedback, single hi-pass on full knob range.<br>
			<br>
			<b>7) 12 DB/OCT BAND-PASS STATE VARIABLE</b>: zero-delay feedback filter with ‘cutoff’ knob you choose the band's centre point and with Resonance knob the width of the band. <br>
			<br>
			<b>8) COMB FILTER</b>: It recreates a series of harmonically related amounts of notch filters. In static state, it sounds similar to a phaser, but with modulation applied to the frequency it comes closer to a flanger. With resonance set to full CW it becomes a resonator. <br>
