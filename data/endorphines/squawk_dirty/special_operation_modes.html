	<h2>Special Operation Modes:</h2>
	 <h3>Summary</h3>
		<p style="text-align: left;">Apart from being able to use different filter types, there are 2 more modes of operation that expand this module’s functionality. <br>
		<br>
	</p>
		
	    <h4>Meta Scanning:</h4>
			<p style="text-align: left;">Meta sequencing allows you to sequence the filter modes with external CV. Every filter type stores the position of Cutoff and Resonance, which lets you sequence the modes using pre configured sweet spots, resulting in a more musical and intentional workflow. <br>
			<br>
			To activate Meta Scanning mode, press the Mode button for 1 second.<br>
			<br>
			The Cutoff knob now acts as your manual offset for the filter type selector. The Cutoff cv input functions as attenuated input for the Filter Cutoff with 0…+5V range.<br>
			<br>
			Resonance knob and Resonance CV input work as a pair for the external CV Meta Scanning. Plug a CV source to the Resonance CV input to scan the Filter Types and use the Resonance knob as your attenuator. The amount of polarised CV is added to the manual offset introduced by the Cutoff knob. Meta (Resonance) CV input accepts voltages in the range of 0…+5V.
			
			</p>

		<h4>All Access Pass:</h4>
			<p style="text-align: left;">All Access pass mode allows you to set a delay amount for OUT2, making the stereo image sound wider. <br>
			<br>
			To activate this mode, hold press the Mode button for longer than 2.5 seconds and the status LED inside the triangle will light up fuchsia.The 4 LEDS will visualise the stereo spread. This will switch the functionality of the HPF knob to control the delay amount on OUT2. Full CCW knob position will set zero delay while full CW will increase OUT2 channel delay to up to 1/3 seconds. Small amounts of allpass delay will create a stereo widening effect. Experiment with the amount to your taste. The HPF cv input will continue to modulate the HPF.<br>
			<br>
			Note: all changes in the All Access Pass settings are saved/stored and will be restored when the module is powered up the next time. <br>
