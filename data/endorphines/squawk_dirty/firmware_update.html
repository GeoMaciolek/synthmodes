		<h3>Firmware Update:</h3>
			<p style="text-align: left;">Download the latest firmware here: 
      		<a class="button" href="https://www.endorphin.es/modules/p/squawk-dirty-to-me"> https://www.endorphin.es/modules/p/squawk-dirty-to-me  </a> <br>
			<br>
				
			The update procedure is done via audio, either computer or phone will work, we advise you to disable all the notifications (flight mode) so that the update is not interrupted. <br>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li> Power OFF you modular system. </li>
				<li> Hold ‘mode’ while powering your system again, you will see the status LED will blink blue.</li>
				<li> Connect the audio output from your computer headphones output to one of the audio inputs of the module with simple mono or stereo cable.  </li>
				<li> Press PLAY and wait 2+ minutes. Use and file player that does not apply audio compression to the file. During the update process you should observe that the BLUE light is blinking faster than usual. The module will reboot automatically after the new firmware has been installed. </li>
				<li> Make sure you don't input any extra sounds during the update process (reminder signals from your calendar, etc.). When the status LED flashes RED – that means the signal is too low or too high – just reset the firmware acquire process by pressing MODE once. This can also happen when you first insert the cable into the audio input.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			Important Note: to prevent the errors during the audio playback of the firmware, please use any audio editor without any effects applied (EQ etc). <br>
