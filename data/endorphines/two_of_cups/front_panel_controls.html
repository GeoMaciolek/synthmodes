			<b>Pitch CV inputs</b>: cv input is for the Pitch of the sample, which follows 1v/oct scaling in range -3...+3V (6 octaves), pitch voltage value added to the manual pitch offset selection knob (red mode). This lets you play the samples melodically using a sequencer or a keyboard. You can adjust the v/oct scale in the settings/pitch_1/2.txt file on the SD card.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Gate inputs</b>: used to trigger the samples, and since the internal envelope is an ASR envelope, you can vary the length of the sample by adjusting the length of the Gate.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Meta cv inputs</b>: accepts cv signals in the range of -5V...+5V. If no CV is applied and no manual sample offset is selected using the Parameter knob, the first sample of each voiceâ€™s folder is chosen.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Clock input</b>: When there is a clock signal applied to the CLOCK IN* jack, the buttons trigger rolls following the clock.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Audio outputs</b>: Each voice has a dedicated audio output, but if no cable is plugged into the Voice 2 audio output, both voices will be summed to the output of Voice 1. Voice 1/2 jack outputs are compatible with the airplane stereo adapter** for further ease of routing. **when using stereo samples, only left channel is played.<br>
