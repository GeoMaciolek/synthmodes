		<p style="text-align: left;">
			Total Recall is a module designed to be your friend both in the studio and on stage, for controlled performance applications as well as experimental sound design. There are 2 main modes, namely Preset Manager mode that lets you step through 8 presets containing 3 CV values and Macro mode, where you can smoothly morph between minimum and maximum voltage values for each of the CV outputs. Each mode can be externally controlled with either triggers / clocks or CV, hence, there are 4 modes in total. <br>
      <br>
      The module has 3 CV inputs and 3 CV outputs. The outputs are used to create voltage offsets (presets) in the range of 0…+5V for unipolar setup and -5V….+5V for bipolar. Additionally you can slew the outputs with an onboard switch to create a smoother transition between voltage stages. <br>
      <br>
      The inputs are used to process either CV or audio sources. Preset manager sets the attenuation / inversion of CV inputs per step and Macro mode acts as a continuous VCA / Polariser that can also be modulated at audio rates, producing extra harmonics similar to the sound of ring modulators.<br>
