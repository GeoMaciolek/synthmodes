	<h2>Total Recall with external CV / Audio sources:</h2>
	 <h3>Summary</h3>
		<p style="text-align: left;">Apart from being a flexible CV generator, Total Recall can also process external CV / Audio in interesting ways depending on the currently selected mode.<br>
		<br>
	</p>
		
	    <h4>Preset Manager mode:</h4>
			<p style="text-align: left;">with CV / Audio patched to each input, the presets will no longer output offsets, but will control the attenuation / attenuversion of each input and direct the resulting voltage to each respective output. This functionality only works if something is plugged to the CV input, otherwise each channel works as an offset generator. This way you can combine both modes for even higher flexibility.<br>
			<br>
		</p>

		<h4>Macro mode:</h4>
			<p style="text-align: left;">Since macro mode doesnâ€™t have Preset Steps, you are able to make continuous transitions. To do this, turn the switch to Smooth position, set the min and max range values for each channel and plug either CV or Audio to one of the inputs. If the Polarity switch is set to Unipolar, the Macro knob will act as the master controller for each channel's VCA, letting you utilise Total Recall as a 3 channel VCA with adjustable min and max points. If the Polarity switch is set to Bipolar, you can use the Macro knob as the master controller for 3 Polarisers / Ring mods. This mode is particularly interesting as it lets you bend and twist your CV sources to create new shapes and since the Macro knob can be modulated at audio rates you can create new harmonics out of already existing audio sources.<br>
