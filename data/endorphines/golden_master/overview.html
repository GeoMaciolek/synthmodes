	  <h2>Overview</h2>

		<p style="text-align: left;">
			Golden Master is a module designed for both live musicians and studio heads that want to take extra care of their modular mix or just give extra punch to specific sounds. Built in end of signal chain limiter makes it a great sound design tool, especially when used for feedback patching. <br>
      <br>
      <h4>The signal chain is designed in the following way:</h4>
      First the signal enters the stereo inputs with an additional gain stage to boost the signal to the right level, which can be especially useful if you are sending it line level signals.
      Next we have 3 bands, each with their own level setting (EQ), mute / enhance button, compressor per band, stereo image enhancer and a final limiter with additional gates, that make sure there is silence when no signal is present at the input.
      <ul>
        <li>Multi-band processor inspired by mastering tools from the 1990s: adds punch and dynamics to your sound</li>
        <li>Compression, EQ, and mid/side processing</li>
        <li>Three frequency bands with +7 db boost and -20 db cut</li>
        <li>Brickwall limiter sets upper limit of signals</li>
        <li>16-bit/96kHz audio I/O with 32 bits internal processing</li>
        <li>Enhance/mute buttons</li>
      </ul>
