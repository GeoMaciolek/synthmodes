      <h3>Golden Master</h3>
      <p>Golden Master is a 6hp multi-band processor, available in both 1U and 3U format, that takes inspiration from studio mastering and radio loudness units from the 1990s. It gives control over the EQ, compression, and mid/side processing of incoming audio.<br>
      <br>
      Thanks to the 16-bit/96kHz audio fidelity, you'll get incredible processing power. It features three bands - low, medium, and high - each handling a distinct portion of the audio spectrum. These controls feature a single knob that both boosts and cuts signals. Set the overall loudness limit of your sounds, and the brickwall limiter ensures all your sounds stay in check. This multi-band effect is the perfect end-of-chain module, ensuring that anything you throw at it sounds dynamic and full.<br>
      <br>
      The 1U version also features Aux in and Mix out pin headers on the back that let you seamlessly set up your signal chain without the use of patch cables. The extra 6 pin connector can be used to wire the master output straight to the Â¼ inch jacks on the intellijel performance case for even better integration and security for live performances.<br>
